# AI Agent TypeScript

A TypeScript implementation of a simple AI agent based on the principles outlined in [How to Build an Agent](https://ampcode.com/how-to-build-an-agent).

## Overview

This project implements a minimal AI agent with three core components:
- **LLM**: Uses Anthropic's Claude as the primary intelligence
- **Memory**: Maintains conversation history across interactions
- **Control Loop**: Orchestrates the conversation flow between user and AI

The agent demonstrates how complex interactions can emerge from a simple, well-structured architecture without requiring complex frameworks.

## Features

- üß† **Claude Integration**: Uses Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet model
- üí≠ **Conversation Memory**: Maintains context across the entire conversation
- üîÑ **Interactive Loop**: CLI interface for real-time conversations
- üìù **TypeScript**: Fully typed implementation for better development experience

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- Yarn package manager
- Anthropic API key

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd ai_agent_typescript
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
yarn install
```

3. Create a `.env` file with your Anthropic API key:
```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

4. Run the agent:
```bash
yarn dev
```

## Usage

Once started, the agent will prompt you for input. Simply type your messages and the agent will respond while maintaining conversation context. Type `exit` to quit.

## Architecture

The agent follows a simple but powerful architecture:

- **Agent Class**: Core orchestrator that manages conversation flow
- **Message Interface**: Type-safe message structure for conversation history
- **Control Loop**: Handles user input/output and maintains conversation state

## Inspiration

This implementation is based on the concepts from [How to Build an Agent](https://ampcode.com/how-to-build-an-agent), which demonstrates that effective AI agents can be built with minimal code by focusing on the right abstractions.
